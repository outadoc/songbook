[intro]

  C            Am                   C       Am
I really can't stay - But baby it's cold outside 
     Dm         G                   Dm      G
I've got to go away - But baby it's cold outside 
     C           Am                      C          Am
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in 
        Dm                    G7
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice 
   F
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry 
    Dm
And father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar 
   F                   
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry 
G7
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour
 
C                   Am                     C       Am
The neighbors might think - But baby, it's bad out there
     Dm             G                     Dm      G
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there 
  C           Am                       C         Am
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now 
              Dm                     G7
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
  F
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move in closer 
   Dm
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride
  C            Am                   C         Am
I really can't stay - Oh baby don't hold out, ahh but it's
Dm   G7 C    Am C Am
Cold outside 

  C           Am                  C       Am
I simply must go - But baby, it's cold outside
    Dm        G                   Dm      G
The answer is no - But baby, it's cold outside 
    C           Am                    C           Am
The welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in 
            Dm                    G7
So nice and warm -- Look out that window at that storm 
   F
My sister will be suspicious - Gosh, your lips look so delicious 
   Dm
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore 
   F
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips are delicious 
     G7
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Never such a blizzard before 

     C         Am                       C          Am
I've got to go home - But, baby, you'll freeze out there 
     Dm           G                      Dm        G
Say, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there 
       C           Am                        C        Am
You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand
              Dm                G7
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me 
        F
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow 
   Dm
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died 
  C            Am                   C        Am
I really can't stay - Get over that old out, ahh, but it's
Dm   G7 C    Am C Am C Am C
Cold outside
