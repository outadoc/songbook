Another (B)bride An(F#7)other June
Another (B)sunny (B7) honey (E)moon (Em)
Another (B)season, another (G7)reason (F#7)
for makin' (B)whoopee (F#7)

A lot of (B)shoes, a lot of (F#7)rice
the groom is nervous. he answers twice
it's really killing that he's so willin'
To make a whoopee

Em               B
Picture a little love nest
Em                   B
down where the roses cling
Em                    B
picture the same sweet love nest 
G7                    F#7
Think what a year can bring

He's washing dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sows
but don't forget folks that's what you get folks
for making whoopee

Another year or maybe less
what's this I hear? Well you can't you guess
She feels neglected and he's suspected
of makin' whoopee

She sits alone most every night
He doesn't phone - he doesn't write
he says he's busy but she say's "is he?"
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
only five thousand per
some judge who thinks he's funny
says he'll pay six to her

he says now judge suppose i fail
the judge says budge straight into jail
you better keep her i think it's cheaper
then making whoopee
