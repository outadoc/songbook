Always look on the bright Side of Life - Monty Python

     Am                 D            G               Em
Some things in life are bad they can really make you mad
      Am                   D         G
Other things just make you swear and curse
            Am                D
When you're chewing an life's gristle
      G              Em
Don't grumble give a whistle
    Am                                   D    D7
And this'll help things turn out for the best

    G      Em          Am     D7      G    Em Am D7
And always look on the bright side of life
   G   Em          Am    D7      G    Em Am D7
Always look on the light side of life

   Am               D              G                Em
If life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
    Am                  D                   G
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
            Am             D     G              Em
When you've feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps
     Am                                       D     D7
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing

    G      Em          Am     D7      G    Em Am D7
And always look on the bright side of life
           G   Em          Am    D7        G   Em Am D7
Come on always look on the bright side of life


     Am               D        G               Em
For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
         Am              D              G
you must always face the curtain with a bow
   Am             D              G          Em
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
  Am                                D    D7
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.

    G      Em          Am     D7      G    Em Am D7
So always look on the bright side of death
G      Em       Am           D7    G      Em Am D7
just before you draw your terminal breath

Am               D    G                Em
Life's a pice if shit when you look at it
Am                 D                   G
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true
       Am             D
You'll see it's all a show
        G               Em
keep'em laughing as you go
       Am                               D7
just remember that the last laugh is on you

    G      Em          Am     D7      G    Em Am D7
And always look on the bright side of life
G      Em          Am    D7      G    Em Am D7
