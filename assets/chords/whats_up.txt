What's up? - 4 Non Blondes

A
Twenty Five years and my life is still
Bm                                      D
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
           A
For a destination
A
I realized quickly when I knew that I should
          Bm                                   D
That the world was made of this brotherhood of man
                  A
For whatever that means

A                                    
And So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Bm
Just to get it all out 
                       D                        A
whats in my head and I, I am feeling a little peculiar.
A 
So I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Bm
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  D                                         A
I Scream at the top of my lungs  WHATS GOIN ON?

Chorus:

A
And I said Heyeyeyeyey 
Bm
Heyeyey
       D               A
I said Hey Whats going on?
A
And I said Heyeyeyeyey 
Bm
Heyeyey
       D               A
I said Hey Whats going on?

A     Bm  D   A
Ooh, Ooh Ooh
      A                   Bm
And I try, oh my god do I try
              D                  A
I try all the time, in this institution
      A                    Bm
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
                    D
I pray every single day
          A
For a revolution

A                                    
And So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Bm
Just to get it all out 
                       D                        A
