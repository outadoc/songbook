F                                     Am
I thought I saw a man brought to life
                                       Dm
He was warm, he came around and he was dignified
   Bb
He showed me what it was to cry
F                                      Am
Well you couldn't be that man I adored
                                                 Dm
You don't seem to know or seem to care what your heart is for
     Bb
Well I don't know him anymore
        Dm                            C
There's nothing where he used to lie, my conversation has run dry   
Am                  C                      F
That's what's going on, nothing's fine I'm torn

               C                    Dm
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                  Bb                        F
I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor
               C                      Dm
Illusion never changed into something real
                   Bb                           F
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
                C                 Dm   Bb
You're a little late, I'm already torn

F                               Am
So I guess the fortune teller's right
                                                    Dm
I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
        Bb
But you crawled beneath my veins and now 
Dm                            C
I don't care, I have no luck, I don't miss it all that much
Am                   C                             F
There's just so many things that I can't touch I'm torn

               C                    Dm
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                  Bb                        F
I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor
               C                      Dm
Illusion never changed into something real
                   Bb                           F
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
                C                 Dm   Bb
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Dm   Bb
Torn

Dm          F           C
hoooooooooo hoohooooooo oooooooo

        Dm                            C
There's nothing where he used to lie, my inspiration has run dry   
Am                  C                      F
That's what's going on, nothing's right I'm torn

               C                    Dm
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                  Bb                        F
I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor
               C                      Dm
Illusion never changed into something real
                   Bb                           F
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
               C                    Dm
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                   Bb                              F
I'm cold and I am ashamed bound and broken on the floor
                C                 Dm   Bb
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Dm   Bb C
Torn

F         C Dm Bb
(Oh ... )
F
Hoh
