Cos, cos, cos I remember when we used to sit

 In a government yard in Trenchtown
C       G          Am          F
Obba, observing the hypocrites
C               G              Am   F
Mingle with the good people we meet
C               G

log a would a burnin' through the nights
C             G             Am      F
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, I say

Of which I'll share with you   (yeah)
C    G        Am           F  
My feet is my only carriage, and so
