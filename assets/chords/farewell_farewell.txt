Bb             F                    C     
Farewell, farewell to you who would hear
    Bb     C          Bb
You lonely travellers all
    F          Bb        F     Dm 
The cold north wind will blow again
    Bb      C         Bb
The winding road does call

             F               C
And will you never return to see
     Bb           C     Bb
Your bruised and beaten sons?
       F        Bb        F         Dm 
"Oh, I would, I would, if welcome I were
         Bb         C       Bb
For they loath me, every one"
             
             F             C
And will you never cut the cloth
   Bb        C        Bb
Or drink the light to be?
    F       Bb    F       Dm
And can you never swear a year
   Bb    C   Bb
To anyone of we?

            F             C
"No, I will never cut the cloth
   Bb        C        Bb
Or drink the light to be
F             Bb        F        Dm
But I'll swear a year to one who lies
 Bb          C       Bb
Asleep along side of me"

Bb             F                    C     
Farewell, farewell to you who would hear
    Bb     C          Bb
You lonely travellers all
    F          Bb        F     Dm 
The cold north wind will blow again
    Bb      C         Bb
The winding road does call

    C         F
Farewell, Farewell
