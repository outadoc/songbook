   [Bmin]                             [D]
An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
  [Bmin]                        [D]          [F#7]
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
     [Bmin]
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
  [G]                          [Emin][Bmin]
A-plowin' through the ragged skies, and up the cloudy draw


         [D]      [Bmin]
Yip-i-ya-a, Yip-i-ya-o
[G]      [Emin] [Bmin]
Ghostriders in the sky


      [Bmin]                                 [D]
Their brands were still on fire and their hoofs were made of steel. 
      [Bmin]                                  [D]               [F#7]
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel. 
  [Bmin]
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky. 
       [G]                    [Emin]  [Bmin]
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry


         [D]      [Bmin]
Yip-i-ya-a, Yip-i-ya-o
[G]      [Emin] [Bmin]
Ghostriders in the sky


      [Bmin]                                         [D]
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
        [Bmin]                                 [D]                  [F#7]
They're riding hard to catch that herd, but they ain't caught them yet
               [Bmin]
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
   [G]              [Emin]       [Bmin]
On horses snorting fire and as they ride I hear them cry


         [D]      [Bmin]
Yip-i-ya-a, Yip-i-ya-o
[G]      [Emin] [Bmin]
Ghostriders in the sky


       [Bmin]                      [D]
As the riders rode on by him he heard one call his name 
       [Bmin]                                [D]         [F#7]
If you want to save your soul from hell a riding on our range 
     [Bmin]
Then cowboy change your ways or with us you will ride 
[G]                          [Emin][Bmin]
Trying to catch the devil's herd across these evil skies


         [D]      [Bmin]
Yip-i-ya-a, Yip-i-ya-o
[G]      [Emin] [Bmin]
Ghostriders in the sky


         [D]      [Bmin]
Yip-i-ya-a, Yip-i-ya-o
[G]      [Emin] [Bmin]
Ghostriders in the sky


[G]      [Emin] [Bmin]
Ghostriders in the sky
