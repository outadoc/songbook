Dm                                                     F
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                           Bb
There was something so pleasant about that phase.

Even your emotions had an echo
              Asus4   A
In so much space
Dm
And when you're out there, without care,
                      F
Yeah, I was out of touch
                                     Bb
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                       Asus4  A
I just knew too much


                  Dm
Does that make me crazy?
                  F
Does that make me crazy??
                  Bb
Does that make me crazy???
                  Asus4     A
Probably.


D                                               Bb
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
            F                     Asus4   A
But think twice, that's my only advice
Dm                                                                     F
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
                      Bb
Ha ha ha bless your soul
                              Asus4       A
You really think you're in control

                     Dm
Well, I think you're crazy!
               F
I think you're crazy!
               Bb
I think you're crazy,
               Asus4   A
Just like me.

D                                                    Bb
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
             F                                    Asus4   A
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Dm                                                               F
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
                               Bb
And it's no coincidence I've come
                         Asus4    A
And I can die when I'm done

          Dm
Maybe I'm crazy
             F
Maybe you're crazy
            Bb
Maybe we're crazy
           Asus4    A
Probably
